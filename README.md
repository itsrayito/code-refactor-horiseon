## The features learned and process

### Knowledge I gained

- CSS and HTML is much better and accesible to navigate throughout an electronic device 
by using Semantic HTML elements and by configuring the CSS.
- By using Class, this helps by merging or reducing copies in CSS, 
And by adding the id attribute to the headings, it will make them more accesible in navigating.
- A title needs to be different and unique.
- Getting used to using Semantic HTML elements and changing the CSS to match the changes. 


### The process used

- Semantic HTML Format
- CSS Elements
